# Genetic Algorithm Blackjack Agent
This repository implements a Machine Learning agent in C built on genetic algorithms utilizing reinforcement learning and simulations to formulate the optimal blackjack playing strategy.

The agent evolves its strategy over generations, aiming to maximize its earnings through simulated gameplay. Allowing for changes in parameters such as population size, mutation rate, and amount of hands played, influencing the agent's performance and runtime.

## Technologies
